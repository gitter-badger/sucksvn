== Notes ==

I hacked this set of scripts to help me in a branch-based development
environment of a Rails projects, that's why there's a 'database.yml'.

If your projects isn't a Rails one, nevermind the 'shared' directory.

== Directory structure needed ==

svn
 |_project
        |_activity.log
        |_branches
        |_trunk
        |_tags
        |_shared
              |_database.yml (if using together a Rails project)

== Environment variables ==

GNU/Linux boxes => .bashrc 
Mac OSX boxes => .profile

  # SucksVN
  export SVNUSER="pompilio"
  export SVNPATH="/home/mauro/src/svn/project"
  export SVNURL="svn.project.net/data/svn/project"
